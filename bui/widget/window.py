"""The Window class.

This class is the main graphical content of any window.  With
[Dialog](dialog.md), chances are you won't need anything else as a
container for your windows.

The Window class contains the controls of your window, as user-defined
methods prefixed with `on`..  It can also contain data models and controls
of the contained widgets (graphical elements) in this window.  Optionally,
it can contain the window layout, though it's recommended to place this
layout in a separate [file](../layout/file.md).

    The Window main class.

    Instanciating it (with `Window()`) will attempt to create and return an
    object of a specific GUI toolkit.  This object will inherit from `Window`
    and will have the exact same methods and attributes.  You should remain
    blessfully ignorant of the real class you use.  BUI is designed in such
    a way that you can ignore how it does its magic for a particular
    GUI toolkit, except if you're coding for such a toolkit.

    Class attributes:
        layout (str, optional): the optional window layout, if it is not
                defined in a separate [file](../layout/file.md).  It is
                recommended to not use this class attribute, but you still
                can do so, if you have your reasons.
        bui (str, optional): the path leading to the `.bui` file
                containing your layout.  By default, this is in the same
                folder and has the same name as the Python file containing
                your Window class, except it has the `.bui` extension.  If
                you use this naming convention, you don't have to override
                the `bui` class attribute.  Otherwise, give it a relative
                or absolute path: absolute paths consider their root to be
                the user directory when the Python application started
                (which might not be the same as the directory in which
                your Python file is contained).

    [Controls]../control/overview.md] are defined as methods on this
    class.  By convention, their name starts with `on_`, like `on_focus` or
    `on_quit`.  You can also watch for widget controls (execute a method
    when a button is pressed, for instance).  In this case, you can create
    `on_{control verb}_{control ID}` like `on_click_button`.  BUI will
    attempt to connect `on*` methods with controls and will tell you if
    it fails, or has a doubt.
