# Control: click

When the user clicks on the widget.

This control probably is the most often used in any window.  It is
triggered when the user clicks on a button or use a similar
trigger.  If the user presses RETURN or SPACE on the widget, and
if the operating system supports this action as a click, this
control is also triggered, which makes things much easier for people
not using the mouse to navigate.
