# Control: right_click

When the user right clicks or presses the application key.

This control is fired when the user right clicks on a widget
or anywhere in the window.  This control is also fired when
the user presses the application key while a widget in the window
is focused.  It is common to link this control to the
[context menu pop-up](../layout/tag/context.md).
